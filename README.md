# eslint-plugin-just-why

A collection of rules that should never be used (and created).

## DISCLAIMER:

I've created this plugin as a joke while learning the [ESLint API](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api), seriously, don't even consider using this plugin in your projects.

## Rules

- no-todo-comment - why set things to be done if we can do it now?
