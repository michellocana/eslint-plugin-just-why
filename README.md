# eslint-plugin-just-why

A collection of rules that should never be used (and created).

## DISCLAIMER:

I've created this plugin as a joke while learning the [ESLint API](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api), seriously, don't even consider using this plugin in your projects.

## Rules

- no-todo-comment - Why set things to be done if we can do it now?
- no-if-else - IOP (If Oriented Programming) is bad, ternary is the future.
- no-literal-object - JSON.parse is faster, why don't you use it?
